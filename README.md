A list of my most commonly used Ubuntu/Windows commands and files.

The main OS I work with is Ubuntu and âˆ´ the majority of the commands are Linux/Debian specific.

My main editor is `vim` due to it being FREE, and being available inside the `shell` on the client and server alike - with awesome syntax highlighting. I have written a basic guide to vim in `commands.md` - check it out!

(In the past I have tried various editors and IDEs, including Titanium, Sublime Text and PHPStorm/WebStorm by JetBrains but they have been either too expensive, too complex or too bulky for my needs)

My secondary editor (for editing text and shell files) is [Geany](http://www.geany.org/).

For customizing the Terminal in Ubuntu I use [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it).

### Contents ###
* `commands.md` - lists my most commonly used Ubuntu/Windows commands. Trust me this list of commands is AWESOME! Check it out right away!
* `.bashrc` - `bash-it` gives a default `.bash_profile` file but this is actually named `.bashrc` in Ubuntu
* `solarized.theme.bash` - my work-in-progress shell theme based off the default theme `bobby`. Create a new folder `solarized` under `~/.bash_it/themes/` and add this file to it.
* `solarized-github.css` - code highlighting for GitHub using [Stylish](http://userstyles.org/stylish/). Install Stylish, create a new theme, paste in this css and add `github.com` as the domain. Bingo!
* `mimeapps.list` - tells Ubuntu which applications to associate with which file types. In this case I've associated .php, .css, .js, .txt to `Geany`. Add under `~/.local/share/applications/` making sure to backup your existing `mimeapps.list` file
