A list of my most commonly used Ubuntu/Windows commands and files.

The main OS I work with is Ubuntu and âˆ´ the majority of the commands are Linux/Debian specific.

My **main editor/IDE** is `atom` (https://atom.io/) due to it being FREE, fast and having plugins which enhance its functionality into a powerful IDE. The main plugins I use with atom are `atom-ternjs`, `atom-typescript` and `goto-definition`.

On the command-line, I like to use `vim` due to it being available inside the `shell` on the client and server alike - with awesome syntax highlighting. I have written a basic guide to vim in `commands.md` - check it out!

(In the past I have tried various editors and IDEs, including Titanium, Sublime Text and PHPStorm/WebStorm by JetBrains but they have been either too expensive, too complex or too bulky for my needs)

My secondary editor (for editing text and shell files) is [Geany](http://www.geany.org/).

For **customizing the Terminal & aliases** I use [bash-it](https://github.com/revans/bash-it) with the theme `powerline-plain`, and for terminal splitting (vertical and horizontal) I use `Terminator` which is available from the Software Center.

For **colour picking** I use `Gpick`, available from the Software Center.

For **producing GIFs** I use `Peek` (https://github.com/phw/peek#ubuntu).

For **diff-ing files** I use `Visual Merge Tool` (https://www.perforce.com/downloads/visual-merge-tool)

For **multiple versions of PHP and Node.js** I use `phpbrew` (https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) & `nvm` (https://github.com/creationix/nvm) respectively.

### Contents ###
* `commands.md` - lists my most commonly used Ubuntu/Windows commands. Trust me this list of commands is AWESOME! Check it out right away!
* `.bashrc` - `bash-it` gives a default `.bash_profile` file but this is actually named `.bashrc` in Ubuntu
* `custom.aliases.bash` - my quick aliases put under `~/,bash_it/custom/`
* `solarized.theme.bash` - my work-in-progress shell theme based off the default theme `bobby`. Create a new folder `solarized` under `~/.bash_it/themes/` and add this file to it.
* `github.md` - a quick guide explaining advanced git branch usage
* `mimeapps.list` - tells Ubuntu which applications to associate with which file types. In this case I've associated .php, .css, .js, .txt to `Geany`. Add under `~/.local/share/applications/` making sure to backup your existing `mimeapps.list` file
