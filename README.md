A list of my most commonly used Ubuntu/Windows commands and files.

The main OS I work with is Lubuntu (A performance-focussed flavour of Ubuntu) and âˆ´ the majority of the commands are Linux/Debian specific.

My **main editor/IDE** is [`VSCode`](https://code.visualstudio.com/) due to it being FREE, fast and having plugins which enhance its functionality into a powerful IDE.

On the command-line, I like to use `vim` due to it being available inside the `shell` on the client and server alike - with awesome syntax highlighting (with `.vimrc`). I have written a basic guide to vim in `commands.md` - check it out!

(In the past I have tried various editors and IDEs, including Atom, Titanium, Sublime Text and PHPStorm/WebStorm by JetBrains but they have been either too expensive, too complex or too bulky for my needs)

For **diff-ing files** I use VSCode's built-in feature.

For **customizing the Terminal & aliases** I change the default shell to `zsh` and then use [`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/) with the default theme `robbyrussell`. For terminal splitting (vertical and horizontal), I use the default `QTerminal` which is available from the Discover centre (`plasma-discover`).

For Mac the setup is the same, except for [`iTerm2`](https://www.iterm2.com/) for terminal splitting.

For **colour picking** I use `Gpick` on Ubuntu, available from the Software Center or `Digital Color Meter` on Mac (built-in).

For **producing GIFs** I use [`Peek`](https://github.com/phw/peek#ubuntu) on Ubuntu or [`Giphy Capture`](https://giphy.com/apps/giphycapture) / [`Gyazo`](https://gyazo.com/en) on Mac.

For **multiple versions of PHP and Node.js** I use [`phpbrew`](https://github.com/phpbrew/phpbrew) & [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) respectively.
